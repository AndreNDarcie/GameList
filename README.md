# History of Video Games
:video_game: Timeline containing a list of games that have consistently been ranked among the best by video game jornalists, divided by generations. [Look here](http://andredarcie.github.io/history-of-video-games)  

## How does it work?

This game list is based on [List of video games considered the best](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_considered_the_best).

The `games.js` file represents the data of the games, for example:
```javascript
gameList: [
  {
    releaseYear: "1972",
    title: "Pong",
    imageUrl: "./gifs/pong.gif",
    description: "PONG is one of the earliest arcade video games.",
    developer: "Atari Inc",
    platform: "Arcade",
    genre: "Sports",
    videoUrl: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/fiShX2pTz9A"
  }
]
```
